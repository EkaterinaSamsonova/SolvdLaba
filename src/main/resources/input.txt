Under the deep blue sky, the ocean waves danced. The waves whispered softly as the wind carried their song. Far out, a lone sailor drifted, watching the waves rise and fall, rise and fall. The sunlight gleamed off the water, casting golden rays that sparkled like jewels on the surface. Each wave brought with it a new story, a new rhythm, yet each one was familiar, as if the ocean itself was repeating an ancient, eternal song.
